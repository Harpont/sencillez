Attributes for the sake of this library, are namespaces that shorten the
declaration of a predefined attribute. These attributes specify detailed
information to the compiler about the state of a particular function or
variable. These attributes are internal to this library and are not intended
for use outside of the context of this library.

The following lists the the attributes and their descriptions found in `attr.h`:
  always_inline - shortens the attribute `__attribute__ ((always_inline))`.
  unused - shortens the attribute `__attribute__ ((unused))`.
