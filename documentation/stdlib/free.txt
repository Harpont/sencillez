Providing standard conventions around calls to free in this library are
particularly challenging due to the nature of the way memory is freed from the
heap. This call does not care so much about the length of the segment at the
address, thus this library must maintain the context of various pointer types
in the core of the operation. If not, it is impossible to derive a pointer
from a pointer within the scope of free in this library.
