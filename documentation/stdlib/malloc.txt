Unlike standard calls to C in this library, calls to malloc are much more
simplistic in its implementation. It all comes down to the way in which the
pointer is used to store or reference some data. As it applies to malloc, this
operation, at a high level, does not care about the segment of a particular
pointer, instead more attention is on the address that the pointer points to and
how much data is needed at that particular address. Therefore a void pointer is
suitable for allocating any segment of data to the heap. However, because of the
nature of this mechanics in this call, it is imperative that this operation be
checked for success or failure. In the event of a failure of this operation,
this library must also as a failure of this call suggests there are larger
problems at hand and potentially damaging situations could arise as a result of
the failure of this function.
